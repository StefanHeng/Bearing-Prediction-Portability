# Prediction Model Portability

MDP Secure Cloud Manufacturing, Control and Automation. 

Given previous bearing degradation failure onset prediction model by Yuntian/Claire Zhao, 
the goal is to adapt the model to a similar dataset (FEMTO Bearing Dataset) for best accuracy. 

Potentially as a next step, try alternative approach that also utilizes previous knowledge, 
e.g. Transfer Learning.
